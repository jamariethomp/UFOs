# UFOs

## Overview

An HTML page has been built in order to allow users to identify specific UFO sightings based on sighting date, city, state, country, and/or UFO shape. HTML, Javascript, and Bootstrap have all been utilized to create a filterable list of sightings that end users can use to narrow their search for results.

## Results

Initially, the page was built so that only a date filter could be utilized; however, there are often several results returned for a single date, which may not meet the end-user's needs. For example, some-30 results are returned for the date of 1/1/2010:

Additional filters can be applied to narrow one's search as needed, as shown below:

End users have the ability to start a seach over, and add and remove filter values as they see fit.

## Summary

### Drawbacks
One drawback of this web page is the lack of visuals in the headings or in the body that might support promotion and usability of the web page. Without a bit more asthetic attention, the page looks rather unstimulating.

### Recommendations
 - The ability to filter on key words in the comments column would further enable an end-user to identify a particular UFO sighting that they may be looking for.

 - As of now, the data supports less than one month's worth of UFO sightings; if more data is available from the original source, it would be beneficial to scrape more of that data and add it to the JavaScript file so that the data on the web page would cover a larger swath of time.
